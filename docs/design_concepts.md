# Design Concepts

Here are the proposed designs for the pages that were not included in the original references. Created to match the "Premium Dark" aesthetic with a desktop-first 16:9 layout.

## 1. Workflow Library (Home)

This page displays all your available workflows.

## 3. Execution Dashboard

The main operational view for monitoring all system activity.

- **Charts**:
  - **Runs vs Successes** (Left): Line chart showing 7-day trend.
  - **Avg Duration** (Right): Bar chart showing performance metrics.
- **Run List**: Real-time log of who/what triggered a workflow, with status and duration.
