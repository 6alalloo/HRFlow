# Scope Management Plan
7.1 Introduction & Objectives
The Scope Management Plan will explain how the project Scope will be defined, baselined, verified and controlled. The Scope is driven by the finalized FR/NFR list and bounded by the MVP. Any change to the scope baseline will be recorded in the scope change log with impacts on schedule, cost, and quality.
The scope will be formally baselined at Milestone 2, from this point forward, all progress, deliverables and performance measures will be assessed against this baseline. The goal is to deliver an MVP that matches the approved requirements while preventing scope creep.
7.2 Roles & Responsibilities (RACI)
| Activity | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Define/maintain scope baseline | Project Manager | Supervisor | Bank ABC (Virtual) | Bahrain Polytechnic PMO |
| Approve CRs that impact scope | Project Manager | Supervisor | Bank ABC (Virtual) | Bahrain Polytechnic PMO |
| Validate Deliverables against acceptance Criteria | Project Manager | Supervisor | Bank ABC (Virtual) | Bahrain Polytechnic PMO |

Table 1 - RACI (Scope)


7.3 Scope Definition
Requirements were gathered firstly by a cause and effect analysis through an Ishikawa Diagram, supplemented via research and comparison with COTS (Power Automate, Zapier),then mapped to deliverables (visual builder, compiler, runtime, parser, templates, dashboard, governance). Tools/techniques: expert judgment and product analysis of similar tools. Deployment alternatives (Azure VM vs local single-node Docker) were considered during definition

Scope Management Approach
The Scope Management Approach comes in a structured, 5 stage iterative approach as follows:
Definition: The initial requirements were collected during the charter and refined through the Functional and non-functional requirements document.
Baselining: The approved scope will be baselined at M2, the baseline will act as the reference for all future work. Any changes after M2 have to go through the formal change control process.
Traceability: All deliverables must be linked to one or more FR/NFR references, to ensure that each output directly contributes to a validated requirement.
Verification: Verification will occur at every key milestone. Each deliverable will be reviewed against the acceptance criteria.
Change Control: Any addition, removal, or change to project deliverables must be submitted through an official Scope Change Request form. The form document should show the reason for change and its expected/estimated impact on the schedule, cost, and quality.
This approach ensures scope discipline throughout the project’s lifecycle and prevents scope creep.

7.11 Work Breakdown Structure
The figures below will represent the work breakdown structure for the entirety of the project, the workload is divided into tasks, or work packages, with subtasks underneath them, to make it more manageable. Each phase has a milestone associated with it. The WBS provides a clear hierarchy of tasks, allowing the project manager to plan, assign, and monitor progress effectively throughout the lifecycle.
The Structure follows and 8 phase model, each phase is divided into work packages and sub-tasks to cover the functional and non-functional requirements of the project.
Figure 1 - Overview of WBS by phases
Firstly, is the overall breakdown of the phases of the project, alongside the set duration of each, the start and finish times, and lastly the predecessors before the next task can start.
2 - Starting off with the initiation phase, wherein the major task is to draft the project charter, and stakeholder recognition and definition, the phase ends with the approval of the project charter.


The planning phase is divided into 2 phases, one to set the scope and the functional and non functional requirements, to be done by the system analyst, and then the second sub-phase to be the schedule, cost, HR, quality, risk, and communication management, to be done by the Project Manager.
4 – Next comes the design phase, which sets the foundation for the product itself, where it involves numerous members of the team, including the developer, network architect, and the UI/UX designer. The phase ends with the design being successfully signed off.


5 – The implementation phase is the longest phase of the project, as it involves the actual building of the project. Its divided into 4 work packages, with subtasks assigned to each. The developer and the network architect are the ones involved in this phase. The end of this phase is signified with the completion of the core features.

6- Phase 6 comes after the core featureset is done, which involves the QA to check that the product meets the quality levels planned for. The phase end is signified by the end of all types of testing, including the non-technical user tests.


7 – Phase 7 goes through the deployment on Docker, and the writing of the user guide and handover docs for future use. Its signified by the completion of the aforementioned tasks.

# Time Management Plan
9.1 Introduction
This section will define how project time will be managed, tracked and controlled through the development process. The schedule management process ensures that tasks are completed within the set period. The schedule will be developed using Microsoft Project, supported by Gantt charts, resource charts, and milestone tracking.

9.2 Objectives
Ensure all project tasks and deliverables are completed within the approved timeframe ending on 28 December 2025.
Define and estimate the duration, effort, and dependencies for every activity in the schedule.
Maintain an accurate and controlled schedule baseline for monitoring progress and performance.
Identify and manage critical paths and milestones to track key checkpoints across all phases.
Apply schedule variance (SV) and performance index (SPI) metrics to evaluate on-time delivery and efficiency.
Support timely reporting and communication of schedule status to the supervisor and PMO.
9.3 Processes
Tool: Microsoft Project. Views used: Gantt, Milestone Chart, Network Diagram, Resource Usage.
Calendar: Sun–Thu working, Fri/Sat non-working.
Structure: 8 phases with one milestone per phase. Tasks are linked Finish-to-Start by default. Where practical, we use Start-to-Start to parallelize UI/backend and documentation.
Estimating: For key tasks, durations are based on an optimistic/most-likely/pessimistic mental model and past lab work.
Baseline: Baseline 0 is set after Planning B (M3) to enable variance and EV tracking.

9.6 Approach
Task dependencies follow standard relationships:
Dependencies
Linear gates: M2 depends on M1, M3 on M2, M4 on M3.
Implementation chain: 5.1 backend → 5.2 nodes/templates → 5.3 parser → 5.4 dashboards/logs → M5.
Testing after M5, Deployment after M6, Handover after M7.
Default FS links, SS only where parallelization is safe (e.g., documentation alongside late testing).


9.7 Changes
Tracking & Control
Weekly updates to % Complete and Actuals.
Baseline variance tracked for Start, Finish, and Duration.
Earned Value (schedule):
SV = EV − PV, SPI = EV / PV (SPI < 1 = behind).
Critical path monitored via Network Diagram.

To measure schedule efficiency:
Schedule Variance (SV) = EV – PV
Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV / PV
SPI = 1 → on schedule
SPI < 1 → behind schedule
SPI > 1 → ahead of schedule


9.8 Reports
Baseline and Gantt chart: The figures below will display the baseline and Gantt charts for the entirety of the project, specifically the start and end dates for each, and the SV and SPI have been added to the project aswell.
1- Figure 9 shows the SPI and Gantt chart for the Initiation and planning phases, as can be seen they’re all with an SPI of 1 as they have been completed right on schedule


Figure 10 displays the SPI and Gantt chart for the Design phase, since it is behind schedule, the SV and SPI numbers aren’t optimal.


Figure 11 shows the baseline and Gantt chart for the implementation phase, which’s time hasn’t come yet, thus the 0 SPI and SV values


Figure 12 shows the baseline and Gantt chart for the implementation phase, which’s time hasn’t come yet, thus the 0 SPI and SV values


The Baseline and Gantt chart for the last 2 phases of the project, which are at 0 for both also due to them being the last phase of the project, wherein we are 2 months away from.

Network Diagram: a visual representation of the project’s tasks and their logical relationships. It shows how activities are connected through dependencies, helping on how to identify the critical path, optimize sequencing, and monitor schedule flow.

# Cost Management Plan
10.1 Introduction
This section outlines the process for planning, estimating, managing and controlling the project costs. The goal is to ensure that the project is completed within its approved budget while delivering all required features and documentation. Costs cover the MVP scope: builder with 8 nodes, compiler to n8n JSON, two templates, CV parser (validated on >=10 CVs), dashboard metrics, RBAC, HTTP allow-list, and append-only audit logs, deployed on a local single-node Docker setup for demo.
Cost management process & tools: Estimating and tracking will be done in MS Project (Cost table, EVM fields) and Excel (NPV/Payback)

10.2 Objectives
Estimate and allocate realistic costs to each phase and work package based on duration, resource effort, and complexity.
Maintain a cost baseline that mirrors the approved project schedule and is used to measure actual performance.
Track and analyze cost performance using Cost Variance (CV) and Cost Performance Index (CPI).
Track and analyze cost performance using Cost Variance (CV) and Cost Performance Index (CPI).
Provide reliable financial data to support decision-making and ensure project delivery within the allocated constraints.
10.3 Processes
Cost management in this project follows four key processes aligned with the PMBOK framework:
Plan Cost Management – Define how costs are estimated, budgeted, and controlled, ensuring consistency with the schedule and scope baselines.
Estimate Costs – Determine the approximate cost of resources, materials, and work packages using standard rates applied in MS Project and Excel.
Determine Budget – Aggregate estimated costs to establish a cost baseline that reflects the total authorized budget for the project.
Control Costs – Monitor cost performance, evaluate variances using EVM metrics, and apply corrective measures to maintain adherence to the budget.


10.4 Roles and Responsibilities (RACI)
| Activity | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Estimate costs for all tasks and resources | Project Manager | Supervisor | Bank ABC (Virtual) | Bahrain Polytechnic PMO |
| Establish and maintain the cost baseline | Project Manager | Supervisor | Bank ABC (Virtual) | Bahrain Polytechnic PMO |
| Track cost performance and update actuals | Project Manager | Supervisor | — | Bahrain Polytechnic PMO |
| Review cost reports and approve corrective actions | Project Manager | Supervisor | Bank ABC (Virtual) | Bahrain Polytechnic PMO |
| Communicate budget status and changes | Project Manager | Supervisor | Bank ABC (Virtual) | Bahrain Polytechnic PMO |

Table 3 - Cost Management RASI
10.5 Cost Management Approach
Cost estimation and control will be executed using Microsoft Project for resource-level costing and Excel (NPV Sheet) for financial analysis and payback evaluation.
Estimation
Each task and phase in the schedule has an assigned standard rate based on the role and expected effort hours. Costs are calculated at the work package level and rolled up to the phase level, maintaining direct connection to the WBS.
Baseline and Tracking
The cost baseline is set after Planning Phase B (Milestone M3), once the schedule and scope baselines are finalized. Progress will be monitored weekly through updates to % Complete and Actual Cost (AC) fields in MS Project.
EVM fields (Planned Value – PV, Earned Value – EV, Actual Cost – AC) will be used to measure cost efficiency and predict future performance.
Key Metrics:
Cost Variance (CV) = EV – AC
Cost Performance Index (CPI) = EV / AC


A CPI of 1.0 would indicate the project is on budget, <1.0 i would indicate over budget, >1.0 would indicate under budget.
Level of Measurement
Cost tracking is done at the work-package level, combined into each project phase (P1–P8). The phases correspond exactly with the schedule and WBS for accurate performance comparison.

10.6 Changes
All cost-related changes are logged and reviewed during weekly checkpoints. Any revision that affects the overall budget or baseline requires Supervisor approval. Adjustments are communicated through a Cost Change Log detailing cause, impact, and action taken.


10.7 Reports

Resource Work Summary report is a graph that shows a quick overview of how much resources have been assigned to each role, how much they completed/used of it.


Figure 27 - Budget Cost report
The budget cost report shows the budgeted cost compared to the baseline cost and the actual cost. The actual cost is currently much lower due to the fact that the project is still underway, but is showing good promise that the project will stay on budget.


The baseline Cost Report gives us a much more detailed view on the differences between the cost alloations between the different phases, and what has been the progress on said phases in terms of spending.

# Quality Management Plan
11.1 Introduction
The objective of this quality management plan is to ensure that the project meets all agreed functional and non-functional requirements within the scope, cost and schedule. The plan defines the quality standards. metrics, and control processes that will guide development, testing and review.
11.2 Roles and responsibilities (RACI)

Table 4 -Quality Management RASI

11.3 Quality Management Approach
Quality will be managed through a combination of planned reviews, standardized testing procedures, and documented acceptance criteria.
Tools: Visual Studio Code, Postman (for API validation), MS Excel (for test logs), and MS Project (for progress tracking).
Framework: PIECES (Performance, Information, Economics, Control, Efficiency, Service).

How we set metrics (research basis): Derived from FR/NFR list and standard web-app norms (API <=2s, UI <=1s, dashboard <=400ms, compile P95 <=2s), security practices (OWASP/ASVS), and project constraints (local deployment, 5 concurrent users, <=3 GB RAM).
M4 Design sign-off: architecture, data model, wireframes reviewed.
M5 Core features complete: builder/compiler/runtime/templates/parser/governance demoed with logs.
M6 Testing complete: unit, integration/E2E, and usability results accepted.
M7 Docs ready: runbook and user guide reviewed against acceptance criteria.

All requirements were derived from stakeholder analysis and refined through the Functional and Non-Functional Requirements list prepared earlier. Metrics are defined to ensure that each quality dimension is measurable.

11.4 Quality Standards & Metrics (PIECES)
Standards are organized by PIECES with measurable metrics and sources: performance, information, economics, control, efficiency, service. 
Examples: builder compiles in <=5 s (system benchmark), or that logs retained 90 days with <=2 s retrieval, cost variance +-10%, auth required for all access, daily commits, consistency in UI, uptime >=99% during demo, descriptive error messages.
| Category | Quality Standard / Metric | Standard Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Performance | Workflow builder executes node compilation within <=5 seconds | System benchmark tests |
| Information | All workflow data is stored accurately with zero duplication | PostgreSQL normalization principles |
| Information | Logs retained for 90 days, retrievable in <=2 seconds | Internal policy |
| Economics | Overall cost variance <= ±10 % of baseline budget | Cost baseline plan |
| Control | Access to system limited to authenticated users only | OWASP Authentication Guidelines |
| Efficiency | Developer commits code daily to maintain version history | Git best practices |
| Efficiency | Reusable code modules across at least two nodes | Internal development guideline |
| Service | UI follows consistent layout and clear labeling (>= 90 % user satisfaction in test survey) | Nielsen UX Heuristics |
| Service | System uptime >= 99 % during demo and evaluation period | Project non-functional requirment |
| Service | Error messages are descriptive and actionable | Internal UX standard |

Table 5 -PIECES Framework Mapping


The following table shows a set of realistic test cases to ensure that the quality sandards are met and to make obvious of any possible flaws within the system.

The Resource work summary report is a great graph to see the planned work in comparison to the actual work hours done, and what is remaining. Its consistent with the current stage of the project where the execution phase hasn’t started yet.


The Resource availibality report is a complement to the summary report, as it shows the work availability, overutilization and under utilization and how much free work is available.


# Communication Plan
13.1 Introduction
Effective communication ensures that all project stakeholders remain informed and engaged throughout the development process of the project. Communication will ensure all the stakeholders receive the right information at the right time.
Effective communication will be structured, consistent, and documented weekly through formal reports (Weekly Journals) and discussions on approved channels (Email and Microsoft Teams)

13.2 Objectives
Ensure the right information reaches the right stakeholders at the right time.
Use consistent channels (Teams, email, shared folder) with weekly documentation.
Provide milestone packets at each gate (M1–M8) and maintain a clear audit trail.

13.3 Communication Approach
The project will use 3 main tools:
Microsoft Teams – for real-time communication, meetings, and document sharing
Email – For formal communication, weekly reporting, and submission of documents
Project folder: status reports, visuals, and evidence (screens, exports).

# Risk Management Plan
14.1 Introduction
The risk management plan defines how uncertanites will be identified, analyzed, monitored and controlled for the project. The goal is to minimize negative impacts on scope, time cost and quality, while ensuring compliance.
14.2 Objectives
Proactively assess and treat risks throughout the lifecycle.
Keep a riskregister ranked by probability and impact to guide action.
Ensure responses are planned, executed, and reviewed at milestones.

Table 13 - Risk Management RACI


14.4 Risk Management Approach

Figure 33 - PESTEL Framework. All rights to https://www.professionalacademy.com/blogs/marketing-theories-pestel-analysis/

We follow a simple, iterative cycle each week: identify → analyze (qualitative 1-5) → plan responses → monitor & control. Re-rank each week and at milestones M3/M4/M5/M6/M7/M8. Probability and Impact are scored 1–5 with labels L/M/H. And a Severity threshold calculated using Probability and Impact.
Timing: Review risks in the Wednesday checkpoint and attach the updated register to the weekly status; re-baseline exposure at M3 (planning done) and M5 (features done).
Tools: Risk Register (this doc); MS Project custom fields for Probability, Impact, and SeverityRoles: PM/Developer owns responses; simulated Analyst/Tester are consulted; Supervisor is informed and approves plan updates.
Budget/Reserves: Track risk work inside the 10% contingency (baseline) with a 5% management reserve off-baseline, matching the Cost Plan.Closure & Lessons Learned: At project close, we log which risks occurred, their effectiveness of responses, and improvements for future projects.
14.5 Risk Register
The risk register logs the risk of each significant part of the project, its owner, category, probability and impact (denoted by severity) and how to mitigate said risk, it’s the core of risk management.

| ID | Risk | Category | P | I | Severity | Owner (R) | Trigger/Indicator | Response strategy & planned actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Schedule slip around compiler/nodes threatens M5 | Schedule | 3 | 5 | 15 H | PM/Dev | Burn rate > plan 2 weeks | Mitigate: re-sequence non-critical UI; split tasks; add nightly builds; weekly micro-demos. |
| R2 | RBAC mis-gates admin/operator paths | Security | 3 | 5 | 15 H | PM/Dev | QA finds privilege leak | Mitigate: role middleware; unit tests; protected admin routes; smoke tests before demo. |
| R3 | Allow-list blocks legit HTTP calls during demo | Security | 3 | 4 | 12 M | PM/Dev | 403 in pre-demo test | Mitigate: pre-load domains; env toggle for “demo allow”; endpoint checklist. |

# Procurement Management Plan
Project procurement covers the goods, services, and supplies needed to complete the platform. For this project, procurement is minimal and software-first: primarily open-source components (Docker, FastAPI, React/TS, libraries) and local tools. Procurement is managed across Planning, Executing, and Monitoring & Controlling phases to ensure quality, fitness for purpose, and on-time availability.

| Activity | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Define procurement needs & criteria | Project Manager | Supervisor | Technical Lead/HR (as applicable) | PMO |
| Source and evaluate candidates | Project Manager | Supervisor | Security/QA reviewers | PMO |
| Acquire/install and verify acceptance | Project Manager | Supervisor | QA/Test | PMO |
| Maintain Procurement Log & versions | Project Manager | Supervisor | — | PMO |
| Control changes (swap/upgrade) | Project Manager | Supervisor | QA/Security | PMO |

Table 14 - Procurment RACI
Planning Procurment :
Document needs: Derive items from WBS and deliverables (builder, compiler, parser, RBAC, dashboard).
Approach: Prefer open-source with permissive licenses (MIT/Apache-2.0), pin versions, keep SBOM/audit logs.
Identify candidates: Shortlist standard, widely-used tools to reduce integration risk.

Execution Procurement :
Acquire & install: Install tools from official sources; verify checksums where applicable.
Evaluate & lock: Run quick fit tests (compile, run, send mail, parse CVs), then lock versions (package-lock/requirements.txt).

# Integration Management Plan and Closing Plan
16.1 Introduction
This plan describes how scope, schedule, cost, quality, risks, communications, HR, and procurement are coordinated as one system. It defines baselines, change control, interfaces between components (builder, compiler, runtime, CV parser, RBAC, allow-list, audit, dashboard), and how decisions flow through the project.

16.2 Objectives:
Keep one coherent baseline (scope/schedule/cost/quality) and control all changes through a single process.
Integrate technical components and data contracts so features work end-to-end.

16.3 Processes and Approaches
Plan/Align: Freeze baselines at M3. Use WBS L3 to link deliverables to tasks, costs, and quality metrics.
Build Order: Backend + RBAC → Node palette (≥8) → Compiler → Templates → CV parser → Execution dashboard → Audit & allow-list.
Governance: Weekly integrated review; milestone gates M4–M7; one change log for everything (scope, time, cost, quality).
Evidence: Each milestone packet includes updated baselines + figures (Gantt baseline, Network Diagram, EVM, quality matrix).

16.4 Closing
Formal Project Closure comes by developing a checklist referencing the WBS and Timeline, ensuring all tasks are completes, all tests are done, and user acceptance testing and final demonstration are finalized and performed while meeting all standards.
